# AlarmCentral-Master
  The Alarm Central Arduino library
## Objective
  This Open-Source Alarm Central was created for whom that want to use
  a simple and cheap home security Solution.
## Third Partie Libraries
    For this library you'll need to use the [Arduino SD](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD) and the [RC-Switch 433Mhz](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch) libraries
## Hardware Requeriments
  * A RF433Mhz Module
  * 2 different color leds for HM interface (In the library construction was used a Green and Red)
  * A Siren or Buzzer
  * A push putton
  * Some 10Kohms Resistance, one for each pull Up/Down.
